## TODO

## Use radix lib for everything needed

## Story app idea
1) Worlds (main items)
-- has timeline (a map with tags on it) and points on timeline load different map
1.1) Story - from a world so a single world can have multiple stories
- basicaly a book / campaign (DnD like) and
uses above features as links etc

2) Characters
- they belong to a story, note a character may belong to multiple stories
- features like background & connections (other characters)
